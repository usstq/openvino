## Introducing MYRIAD Plugin

The OpenVINO Runtime MYRIAD plugin has been developed for inference of neural networks on Intel&reg; Neural Compute Stick 2.

## Configuring the MYRIAD Plugin

To configure your Intel® Vision Accelerator Design With Intel® Movidius™ on supported operating systemss, refer to the Steps for Intel® Vision Accelerator Design with Intel® Movidius™ VPUs section in the installation guides for [Linux](../../install_guides/installing-openvino-linux.md) or [Windows](../../install_guides/installing-openvino-windows.md).

 > **NOTE**: The HDDL and MYRIAD plugins may cause conflicts when used at the same time.
> To ensure proper operation in such a case, the number of booted devices needs to be limited in the 'hddl_autoboot.config' file.
> Otherwise, the HDDL plugin will boot all available Intel® Movidius™ Myriad™ X devices.

## Supported Configuration Parameters

See VPU common configuration parameters for the [VPU Plugins](VPU.md).
When specifying key values as raw strings (that is, when using the Python API), omit the `KEY_` prefix.

In addition to common parameters, the MYRIAD plugin accepts the following options:

| Parameter Name        | Parameter Values | Default    | Description                                                                        |
| :---                  | :---             | :---       | :---                                                                               |
| `KEY_VPU_MYRIAD_PROTOCOL`    | empty string/`VPU_MYRIAD_USB`/`VPU_MYRIAD_PCIE` | empty string | If set, the plugin will use a device with specific protocol to allocate a network. |
| `KEY_VPU_MYRIAD_FORCE_RESET` | `YES`/`NO`                             | `NO`        | Enables force reset of all booted devices when new ExecutableNetwork is created.<br />This is a plugin scope option and must be used with the plugin's SetConfig method only.<br />See <a href="#MYRIAD_DEVICE_ALLOC">Device allocation</a> section for details. |
| `KEY_VPU_FORCE_RESET`        | `YES`/`NO`                             | `NO`         | **Deprecated** Use `KEY_VPU_MYRIAD_FORCE_RESET` instead. <br />Enables force reset of all booted devices when new ExecutableNetwork is created.<br />This is a plugin scope option and must be used with the plugin's SetConfig method only.<br />See <a href="#MYRIAD_DEVICE_ALLOC">Device allocation</a> section for details. |

## Device allocation <a name="MYRIAD_DEVICE_ALLOC">&nbsp;</a>

Each `IExecutableNetwork` instance tries to allocate new device on `InferenceEngine::Core::LoadNetwork`, but if all available devices are already allocated it will use the one with the minimal number of uploaded networks.
The maximum number of networks a single device can handle depends on device memory capacity and the size of the networks.

If the `KEY_VPU_MYRIAD_FORCE_RESET` option is set to `YES`, the plugin will reset all VPU devices in the system.

Single device cannot be shared across multiple processes.
