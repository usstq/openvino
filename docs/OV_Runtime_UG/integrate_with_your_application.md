## Use OpenVINO™ Runtime API to Implement Inference Pipeline

This section provides step-by-step instructions to implement a typical inference pipeline with the OpenVINO™ Runtime C++ API:

![ie_api_use_cpp]

### Step 1. Create OpenVINO™ Runtime Core 

Include next files to work with OpenVINO™ Runtime:

@sphinxdirective

.. tab:: C++

    .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.cpp
       :language: cpp
       :fragment: [include]

.. tab:: Python

    .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.py
       :language: python
       :fragment: [import]

@endsphinxdirective

Use the following code to create OpenVINO™ Core to manage available devices and read model objects:

@sphinxdirective

.. tab:: C++

    .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.cpp
       :language: cpp
       :fragment: [part1]

.. tab:: Python

    .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.py
       :language: python
       :fragment: [part1]

@endsphinxdirective

### Step 2. Compile the Model

`ov::CompiledModel` class represents a device specific compiled model. `ov::CompiledModel` allows you to get information inputs or output ports by a tensor name or index.

Compile the model for a specific device using `ov::Core::compile_model()`:

@sphinxdirective

.. tab:: C++

    .. tab:: IR

        .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.cpp
           :language: cpp
           :fragment: [part2_1]

    .. tab:: ONNX

        .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.cpp
           :language: cpp
           :fragment: [part2_2]

    .. tab:: PaddlePaddle

        .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.cpp
           :language: cpp
           :fragment: [part2_3]

    .. tab:: ov::Model

        .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.cpp
           :language: cpp
           :fragment: [part2_4]

.. tab:: Python

    .. tab:: IR

        .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.py
           :language: python
           :fragment: [part2_1]

    .. tab:: ONNX

        .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.py
           :language: python
           :fragment: [part2_2]

    .. tab:: PaddlePaddle

        .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.py
           :language: python
           :fragment: [part2_3]

    .. tab:: ov::Model

        .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.py
           :language: python
           :fragment: [part2_4]

@endsphinxdirective

The `ov::Model` object represents any models inside the OpenVINO™ Runtime.
For more details please read article about [OpenVINO™ Model representation](model_representation.md).

The code above creates a compiled model associated with a single hardware device from the model object.
It is possible to create as many compiled models as needed and use them simultaneously (up to the limitation of the hardware resources).
To learn how to change the device configuration, read the [Query device properties](./supported_plugins/config_properties.md) article.

### Step 3. Create an Inference Request

`ov::InferRequest` class provides methods for model inference in the OpenVINO™ Runtime.
This section demonstrates a simple pipeline, to get more information about other use cases, read the [InferRequest documentation](./ov_infer_request.md) dedicated article.
Create an infer request using the following code:

@sphinxdirective

.. tab:: C++

    .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.cpp
       :language: cpp
       :fragment: [part3]

.. tab:: Python

    .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.py
       :language: python
       :fragment: [part3]

@endsphinxdirective

### Step 4. Set Inputs

You can use external memory to create `ov::Tensor` and use the `ov::InferRequest::set_input_tensor` method to put this tensor on the device:

@sphinxdirective

.. tab:: C++

    .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.cpp
       :language: cpp
       :fragment: [part4]

.. tab:: Python

    .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.py
       :language: python
       :fragment: [part4]

@endsphinxdirective

### Step 5. Start Inference

OpenVINO™ Runtime supports inference in asynchronous or synchronous mode. Async API usage can improve overall frame-rate of the application, because rather than wait for inference to complete, the app can continue doing things on the host, while the accelerator is busy. You can use `ov::InferRequest::start_async()` to start model inference in the asynchronous mode and call `ov::InferRequest::wait()` to wait for the inference results:

@sphinxdirective

.. tab:: C++

    .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.cpp
       :language: cpp
       :fragment: [part5]

.. tab:: Python

    .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.py
       :language: python
       :fragment: [part5]

@endsphinxdirective

The asynchronous mode supports two methods to get the inference results:
  * `ov::InferRequest::wait_for()` - Waits until the specified timeout (in milliseconds) has elapsed or the inference result becomes available, whichever comes first.
  * `ov::InferRequest::wait()` - Waits until the inference result becomes available.

Both requests are thread-safe, which means they can be called from different threads without exposing erroneous behavior or producing unpredictable results.

While the request is ongoing, all its methods except `ov::InferRequest::cancel`, `ov::InferRequest::wait` or `ov::InferRequest::wait_for` throw
the `ov::Busy` exception indicating the request is busy with computations.

### Step 6. Process the Inference Results 

Go over the output tensors and process the inference results.

@sphinxdirective

.. tab:: C++

    .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.cpp
       :language: cpp
       :fragment: [part6]

.. tab:: Python

    .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/src/main.py
       :language: python
       :fragment: [part6]

## Link and Build Your C++ Application with OpenVINO™ Runtime

The example uses CMake for project configuration.

1. **Create a structure** for the project:
   ``` sh
   project/
       ├── CMakeLists.txt  - CMake file to build
       ├── ...             - Additional folders like includes/
       └── src/            - source folder
           └── main.cpp
   build/                  - build directory
       ...      
   ```

2. **Include OpenVINO™ Runtime libraries** in `project/CMakeLists.txt`

   @snippet snippets/CMakeLists.txt cmake:integration_example

To build your project using CMake with the default build tools currently available on your machine, execute the following commands:

> **NOTE**: Make sure you set environment variables first by running `<INSTALL_DIR>/setupvars.sh` (or `setupvars.bat` for Windows). Otherwise the `OpenVINO_DIR` variable won't be configured properly to pass `find_package` calls.

```sh
cd build/
cmake ../project
cmake --build .
```
It's allowed to specify additional build options (e.g. to build CMake project on Windows with a specific build tools). Please refer to the [CMake page](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#manual:cmake(1)) for details.

## Run Your Application

Congratulations, you have made your first application with OpenVINO™ toolkit, now you may run it.
