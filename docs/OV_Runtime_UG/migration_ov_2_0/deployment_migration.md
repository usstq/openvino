# Installation & Deployment {#openvino_2_0_deployment}

"Easy to use" is one of the main concepts for OpenVINO™ API 2.0. It is about simplifying migration from different frameworks to OpenVINO, but also touches on how OpenVINO is organized, how its development tools are used, and how OpenVINO-based applications are developed and deployed.

To accomplish that, we made some changes to the installation and deployment processes of OpenVINO in the 2022.1 release. This guide will walk you through them.

## The Installer Package Contains OpenVINO™ Runtime Only

Starting from OpenVINO 2022.1, development tools are distributed via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/openvino-dev/) only and are no longer included in the OpenVINO installer package. For a list of these components, refer to the [installation overview](../../../install_guides/installing-openvino-overview.md). This approach has several benefits:

* simplifies the user experience - in previous versions, installation and usage of OpenVINO Development Tools differed from one distribution type to another (the OpenVINO installer vs. PyPI), 
* ensures that dependencies are handled properly via the PIP package manager and support virtual environments of development tools.

The structure of the OpenVINO 2022.1 installer package has been organized as follows:

- The `runtime` folder includes headers, libraries and CMake interfaces.
- The `tools` folder contains [the compile tool](../../../tools/compile_tool/README.md), [deployment manager](../../OV_Runtime_UG/deployment/deployment-manager-tool.md), and a set of `requirements.txt` files with links to the corresponding versions of the `openvino-dev` package.
- The `python` folder contains the Python version for OpenVINO Runtime.

## Installing OpenVINO Development Tools via PyPI

Since OpenVINO Development Tools is no longer in the installer package, the installation process has also changed. This section describes it through a comparison with previous versions.

### For Versions Prior to 2022.1

In previous versions, OpenVINO Development Tools was a part of the main package. After the package was installed, to convert models (for example, TensorFlow), you needed to install additional dependencies by using the requirement files, such as `requirements_tf.txt`, install Post-Training Optimization tool and Accuracy Checker tool via the `setup.py` scripts, and then use the `setupvars` scripts to make the tools available to the following command:

```sh
$ mo.py -h
```

### For 2022.1 and After

In OpenVINO 2022.1 and later, you can install the development tools from a [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/openvino-dev/) repository only, using the following command (taking TensorFlow as an example):

```sh
$ python3 -m pip install -r <INSTALL_DIR>/tools/requirements_tf.txt 
```

This will install all the development tools and additional components necessary to work with TensorFlow via the `openvino-dev` package (see **Step 4. Install the Package** on the [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/openvino-dev/) for parameters of other frameworks).

Then, the tools can be used by commands like:

```sh
$ mo -h
$ pot -h
```

You don't have to install any other dependencies. For more details on the installation steps, see [Install OpenVINO Development Tools](../../install_guides/installing-model-dev-tools.md).

## Interface Changes for Building C/C++ Applications

The new OpenVINO Runtime with its API 2.0 has also brought some changes for building C/C++ applications.

### CMake Interface

The CMake interface has been changed as follows:

**With Inference Engine of previous versions**:

```cmake
find_package(InferenceEngine REQUIRED)
find_package(ngraph REQUIRED)
add_executable(ie_ngraph_app main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(ie_ngraph_app PRIVATE ${InferenceEngine_LIBRARIES} ${NGRAPH_LIBRARIES})
```

**With OpenVINO Runtime 2022.1 (API 2.0)**:

```cmake
find_package(OpenVINO REQUIRED)
add_executable(ov_app main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(ov_app PRIVATE openvino::runtime)

add_executable(ov_c_app main.c)
target_link_libraries(ov_c_app PRIVATE openvino::runtime::c)
```

### Native Interfaces

To build applications without the CMake interface, you can also use MSVC IDE, UNIX makefiles, and any other interface, which has been changed as shown here:

**With Inference Engine of previous versions**:

## Clearer Library Structure for Deployment

OpenVINO 2022.1 introduced a reorganization of the libraries, to make deployment easier. In the previous versions, to perform deployment steps, you had to use several libraries. Now you can just use `openvino` or `openvino_c` based on your developing language, together with the necessary plugins to complete your task. For example, `openvino_intel_cpu_plugin` and `openvino_ir_frontend` plugins will enable you to load OpenVINO IRs and perform inference on the CPU device (see [Local distribution with OpenVINO](../deployment/local-distribution.md) for more details).

Here you can find detailed comparisons on the library structure between OpenVINO 2022.1 and the previous versions:

* A single core library with all the functionalities (`openvino` for C++ Runtime, `openvino_c` for Inference Engine API C interface) is used in 2022.1, instead of the previous core libraries which contained `inference_engine`, `ngraph`, `inference_engine_transformations` and `inference_engine_lp_transformations`.
* The optional `inference_engine_preproc` preprocessing library (if `InferenceEngine::PreProcessInfo::setColorFormat` or `InferenceEngine::PreProcessInfo::setResizeAlgorithm` is used) has been renamed to `openvino_gapi_preproc` and deprecated in 2022.1. See more details on [Preprocessing capabilities of OpenVINO API 2.0](preprocessing.md).
* The libraries of plugins have been renamed as follows:
   * `openvino_intel_cpu_plugin` is used for [CPU](../supported_plugins/CPU.md) device instead of `MKLDNNPlugin`.
   * `openvino_intel_gpu_plugin` is used for [GPU](../supported_plugins/GPU.md) device instead of `clDNNPlugin`.
   * `openvino_auto_plugin` is used for [Auto-Device Plugin](../auto_device_selection.md).
* The plugins for reading and converting models have been changed as follows:
   * `openvino_ir_frontend` is used to read IRs instead of `inference_engine_ir_reader`.
   * `openvino_onnx_frontend` is used to read ONNX models instead of `inference_engine_onnx_reader` (with its dependencies). 
   * `openvino_paddle_frontend` is added in 2022.1 to read PaddlePaddle models.

<!-----
Older versions of OpenVINO had several core libraries and plugin modules:
- Core: `inference_engine`, `ngraph`, `inference_engine_transformations`, `inference_engine_lp_transformations`
- Optional `inference_engine_preproc` preprocessing library (if `InferenceEngine::PreProcessInfo::setColorFormat` or `InferenceEngine::PreProcessInfo::setResizeAlgorithm` are used)
- Plugin libraries:
 - `MKLDNNPlugin` for [CPU](../supported_plugins/CPU.md) device
 - `clDNNPlugin` for [GPU](../supported_plugins/GPU.md) device
 - `MultiDevicePlugin` for [Multi-device execution](../multi_device.md)
 - others
- Plugins to read and convert a model:
 - `inference_engine_ir_reader` to read OpenVINO IR
 - `inference_engine_onnx_reader` (with its dependencies) to read ONNX models
Now, the modularity is more clear:
- A single core library with all the functionality `openvino` for C++ runtime
- `openvino_c` with Inference Engine API C interface
- **Deprecated** Optional `openvino_gapi_preproc` preprocessing library (if `InferenceEngine::PreProcessInfo::setColorFormat` or `InferenceEngine::PreProcessInfo::setResizeAlgorithm` are used)
 - Use [preprocessing capabilities from OpenVINO 2.0](../preprocessing_overview.md)
- Plugin libraries with clear names:
 - `openvino_intel_cpu_plugin`
 - `openvino_intel_gpu_plugin`
 - `openvino_auto_plugin`
 - others
- Plugins to read and convert models:
 - `openvino_ir_frontend` to read OpenVINO IR
 - `openvino_onnx_frontend` to read ONNX models
 - `openvino_paddle_frontend` to read Paddle models
