## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to install the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit. Links are provided for each type of compatible hardware including downloads, initialization and configuration steps. The following steps will be covered:

1. <a href="#install-openvino">Install the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit</a>
2. <a href="#set-the-environment-variables">Configure the Environment</a>
3. <a href="#model-optimizer">Download additional components (Optional)</a>
4. <a href="#optional-steps">Configure Inference on non-CPU Devices (Optional)</a>
5. <a href="#get-started">What's next?</a>

## <a name="install-openvino"></a>Step 1: Install the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit Core Components

1. Download the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit package file from [Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit for Windows](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit/choose-download).
   Select the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit for Windows package from the dropdown menu.

2. Go to the `Downloads` folder and double-click `w_openvino_toolkit_p_<version>.exe`. In the opened window, you can select the folder where installer files will be placed. The directory will be referred to as <INSTALL_DIR> elsewhere in the documentation. Once the files are extracted, you should see the following dialog box open up:

     :width: 400px
     :align: center

3. Follow the instructions on your screen. During the installation you will be asked to accept the license agreement. Your acceptance is required to continue. Check out the installation process in the image below:<br>
   ![](../img/openvino-install-win-run-boostrapper-script.gif)
   Click on the image to see the details.
   <br>
   <br>By default, the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ is installed to the following directory, referred to as `<INSTALL_DIR>` elsewhere in the documentation: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\openvino_<version>/`.

   <br>For simplicity, a symbolic link to the latest installation is also created: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\openvino_2022/`.

To check **Release Notes** please visit: [Release Notes](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/OpenVINO-RelNotes).

The core components are now installed. Continue to the next section to configure environment.

## <a name="set-the-environment-variables">Step 2: Configure the Environment

> **NOTE**: If you installed the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ to a non-default install directory, replace `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel` with that directory in this guide's instructions.

You must update several environment variables before you can compile and run OpenVINO™ applications. Open the Command Prompt, and run the `setupvars.bat` batch file to temporarily set your environment variables:

```sh
"<INSTALL_DIR>\setupvars.bat"
```

**Optional**: OpenVINO™ toolkit environment variables are removed when you close the command prompt window. You can permanently set the environment variables manually.

> **NOTE**: If you see an error indicating Python is not installed when you know you installed it, your computer might not be able to find the program. Check your system environment variables, and add Python if necessary.

The environment variables are set. Next, you can download some additional tools.

## <a name="model-optimizer">Step 3 (Optional): Download additional components

> **NOTE**: Since the OpenVINO™ 2022.1 release, the following development tools: Model Optimizer, Post-Training Optimization Tool, Model Downloader and other Open Model Zoo tools, Accuracy Checker, and Annotation Converter are not part of the installer. The OpenVINO™ Development Tools can only be installed via PyPI now. See [Install OpenVINO™ Development Tools](installing-model-dev-tools.md) for detailed steps.

.. dropdown:: OpenCV

   OpenCV is necessary to run demos from Open Model Zoo (OMZ). Some OpenVINO samples and demos also use OpenCV as a dependency. The Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ provides a script to install OpenCV: ``<INSTALL_DIR>/extras/scripts/download_opencv.sh``.

   .. note::
      No prerequisites are needed.

   There are three ways to run the script:

   * GUI: right-click the script and select ``Run with PowerShell``.

   * Command prompt (CMD) console:

   .. code-block:: sh

      powershell <INSTALL_DIR>\extras\scripts\download_opencv.ps1


   * PowerShell console:

   .. code-block:: sh

      .\<INSTALL_DIR>\scripts\download_opencv.ps1


   If the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ is installed to the system location (e.g. ``Program Files (x86)``) then privilege elevation dialog will be shown. The script can be run from CMD/PowerShell Administrator console to avoid this dialog in case of system-wide installation.
   The script is interactive by default, so during the execution it will wait for user to press ``Enter`` If you want to avoid this, use the ``-batch`` option, e.g. ``powershell <openvino>\extras\scripts\download_opencv.ps1 -batch``. After the execution of the script, you will find OpenCV extracted to ``<INSTALL_DIR>/extras/opencv``.
