# Configurations for Intel® Gaussian & Neural Accelerator (GNA) with Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit {#openvino_docs_install_guides_configurations_for_intel_gna}

This page introduces additional configurations for Intel® Gaussian & Neural Accelerator (GNA) with Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit on Linux and Windows.

> **NOTE**: On platforms where Intel® GNA is not enabled in the BIOS, the driver cannot be installed, so the GNA plugin uses the software emulation mode only.

### Drivers and Dependencies

Intel® GNA hardware requires a driver to be installed on the system.
