## Install OpenVINO Runtime

### Step 1: Set Up the OpenVINO Toolkit APT Repository

1. Install the GPG key for the repository

    a. Download the [GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS.PUB](https://apt.repos.intel.com/intel-gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS.PUB). You can also use the following command:
      ```sh
      wget https://apt.repos.intel.com/intel-gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS.PUB
      ```    
    b. Add this key to the system keyring:
      ```sh
      sudo apt-key add GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS.PUB
      ```
      > **NOTE**: You might need to install GnuPG: `sudo apt-get install gnupg`   
      
2.	Add the repository via the following command:
@sphinxdirective

.. tab:: Ubuntu 18

   .. code-block:: sh

      echo "deb https://apt.repos.intel.com/openvino/2022 bionic main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intel-openvino-2022.list

.. tab:: Ubuntu 20

   .. code-block:: sh

      echo "deb https://apt.repos.intel.com/openvino/2022 focal main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intel-openvino-2022.list

@endsphinxdirective


3.	Update the list of packages via the update command:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   ```       
   
4.	Verify that the APT repository is properly set up. Run the apt-cache command to see a list of all available OpenVINO packages and components:
   ```sh
   apt-cache search openvino
   ```   
   

### Step 2: Install OpenVINO Runtime Using the APT Package Manager

OpenVINO will be installed in: `/opt/intel/openvino_<VERSION>.<UPDATE>.<PATCH>`
    
A symlink will be created: `/opt/intel/openvino_<VERSION>`

#### To Install the Latest Version

Run the following command:
```sh
sudo apt install openvino
```

#### To Install a Specific Version


1.	Get a list of OpenVINO packages available for installation:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-cache search openvino
   ```
2.	Install a specific version of an OpenVINO package:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install openvino-<VERSION>.<UPDATE>.<PATCH>
   ```
    For example:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install openvino-2022.1.0
   ```

#### To Check for Installed Packages and Versions

Run the following command:
```sh
apt list --installed | grep openvino
```

#### To Uninstall the Latest Version

Run the following command:
```sh
sudo apt autoremove openvino
```

#### To Uninstall a Specific Version

Run the following command:
```sh
sudo apt autoremove openvino-<VERSION>.<UPDATE>.<PATCH>
```

### Step 3 (Optional): Install OpenCV from APT

OpenCV is necessary to run C++ demos from Open Model Zoo. Some OpenVINO samples can also extend their capabilities when compiled with OpenCV as a dependency. OpenVINO provides a package to install OpenCV from APT:

#### To Install the Latest Version of OpenCV

Run the following command:
```sh
sudo apt install openvino-opencv
```

#### To Install a Specific Version of OpenCV

Run the following command:
```sh
sudo apt install openvino-opencv-<VERSION>.<UPDATE>.<PATCH>
```

### Step 4 (Optional): Install Software Dependencies

After you have installed OpenVINO Runtime, if you decided to [install OpenVINO Development Tools](installing-model-dev-tools.md), make sure that you install external software dependencies first. 

Refer to <a href="openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_linux.html#install-external-dependencies">Install External Software Dependencies</a> for detailed steps.


### Step 5 (Optional): Configure Inference on Non-CPU Devices

@sphinxdirective

.. tab:: GNA

   To enable the toolkit components to use Intel® Gaussian & Neural Accelerator (GNA) on your system, follow the steps in :ref:`GNA Setup Guide <gna guide>`.
   
.. tab:: GPU

   To enable the toolkit components to use processor graphics (GPU) on your system, follow the steps in :ref:`GPU Setup Guide <gpu guide>`.

.. tab:: NCS 2

   To perform inference on Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2 powered by the Intel® Movidius™ Myriad™ X VPU, follow the steps on :ref:`NCS2 Setup Guide <ncs guide>`.
   <!--For more details, see the `Get Started page for Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2 <https://software.intel.com/en-us/neural-compute-stick/get-started>`.-->

.. tab:: VPU

   To install and configure your Intel® Vision Accelerator Design with Intel® Movidius™ VPUs, see the :ref:`VPU Configuration Guide <vpu guide>`.
   After configuration is done, you are ready to run the verification scripts with the HDDL Plugin for your Intel® Vision Accelerator Design with Intel® Movidius™ VPUs. 

   .. warning::
      While working with either HDDL or NCS, choose one of them as they cannot run simultaneously on the same machine.
